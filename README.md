# [HackerRank](hackerrank.com/Gurupad)

This is my code repository of HackerRank contests and some practice problems. I like programming in python
as it is really easy and quick to code. It has also made me a lazy programmer too.

Some of them are in C++ were python just takes too much time.


If you think you've a better code to any of the problems let me know.
PS : That doesn't mean I'm asking you to fix bugs or solve partially solved problems :P.
